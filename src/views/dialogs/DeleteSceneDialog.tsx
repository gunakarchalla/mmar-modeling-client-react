// Port of `dialogs/dialog-delete-scene/{ts,html}` — deletes a SceneInstance from the
// database, then drops that one node from the tree and publishes 'updateSceneGroup' to
// re-render. Opened from the SceneGroup tree's "Delete" context-menu item via uiStore
// 'deleteScene', with the right-clicked scene as its `{ sceneInstance }` payload.
//
// It used to publish an 'initSceneGroup' event instead, which made SceneGroup rebuild
// the whole tree: refetch every metamodel file, every SceneType and every expanded
// type's fully hydrated scenes. (That channel is gone — this was its only publisher.) None of that can have changed — the delete touched the instance
// layer only — and the rebuild dropped the tree's local-only nodes (imported metamodels
// and models, scenes created with autoSave off). scene-tree-service's
// `removeSceneInstanceFromTree` does the one thing the delete actually implies; see its
// note for why the tree had no removal path before.
//
// The payload is REQUIRED, and the dialog is a plain confirmation rather than the old
// picker: the user already chose the scene by right-clicking it, so all that is left is
// the "are you sure?" that an irreversible action deserves. Dropping the picker also
// drops the loadAllSceneInstances() call that fetched every scene in the database fully
// hydrated just to fill a dropdown (see CopySceneDialog's note).
//
// The old class injected eight collaborators but used exactly one (fetchHelper) — the
// rest are dropped here, the same pruning P5/P7 did.
//
// If the deleted scene happens to be open in a tab, that tab is closed as part of the
// deletion (via tabActions.closeTab), so a stale tab can't survive to re-create the
// scene on its next auto-save PATCH (persistency-handler falls back to POST on a 404).
