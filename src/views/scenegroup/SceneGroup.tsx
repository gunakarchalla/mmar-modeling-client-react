/**
 * Port of `views/scenegroup/scenegroup.{ts,html}` (plan §10: ★ modeling-unique).
 * Builds the SceneType -> SceneInstance tree and opens a SceneInstance on double-click
 * (with snapshot rollback).
 *
 * CONTEXT MENUS: the four scene actions used to be a row of buttons above the tree,
 * each opening a dialog that then made the user pick the scene back out of a dropdown —
 * even though they had just clicked the scene in the tree. They are now right-click
 * menus on the tree rows themselves, and the node under the cursor is passed to the
 * dialog as its payload:
 *   SceneType     -> Create (that type preselected)
 *   SceneInstance -> Open / Create (its parent type preselected) / Duplicate / Rename /
 *                    Share / Delete, each prefilled with that scene.
 *   empty space   -> Create with nothing preselected (the old toolbar button's job)
 * Because the scene is now always known, the Duplicate/Delete/Share dialogs no longer
 * have a scene picker at all — and so no longer call loadAllSceneInstances(), which
 * hydrated every scene in the database to fill one (see each dialog's note). Delete is
 * a confirmation. Double-click to open (and its red hint) is unchanged.
 *
 * WIDGET CHOICE (plan §4 left this to the P7 agent, recorded in state.json): nested
 * MUI `List` + `Collapse` (a 2-level tree), NOT @mui/x-tree-view — no new dependency
 * for a two-level structure. The old `mdc-tree-view` selected on click and used a
 * 500 ms double-click counter; here we use the native `onDoubleClick` and a plain
 * selection/expand state (the counter is unnecessary in React).
 *
 * COLLABORATION (P10): `maybeAttachSharedSession` attaches a shared yjs session when
 * a scene has >=2 access entries, and the component subscribes 'sharedSceneReconnected'
 * (reload the scene from the freshly fetched SceneInstance) / 'sceneAccessRevoked'
 * (alert + close the tab), which the old client wired in its constructor.
 *
 * The tree is loaded once the component mounts (which only happens after login), but
 * ONLY down to the SceneType level: each type's SceneInstances are fetched the first
 * time its arrow is expanded, by scene-tree-service. The old eager version fetched
 * every instance of every type at mount, and the server hydrates each scene in full
 * (classes, relations, ports, attributes, roles), so startup cost scaled with the whole
 * database instead of with the scene being opened. The one consumer that still needs
 * all scenes at once (the reference-attribute dialog — a reference may point into a
 * scene the user never expanded) calls `loadAllSceneInstances()` behind its own
 * spinner.
 *
 * The canonical arrays live on globalObject.sceneTypes / globalObject.sceneTree (the
 * old design — instance-utility.getAllSceneInstancesFromLocal reads sceneTree); the
 * component mirrors them into local state to render.

/**
 * Port of `scenegroup.maybeAttachSharedSession` (P10). A scene becomes collaborative
 * as soon as at least two users hold access to it; the caller's own level decides
 * whether the session is read-only.
 *
 * The old body wrapped everything in try/catch because a fetchHelper failure threw;
 * this port's backendService logs-and-returns `[]` / `{level:null}` instead (P1's
 * convention), which lands on exactly the same outcomes: `[]` -> fewer than 2 entries
 * -> stays non-shared, and a null level -> keeps the 'edit' fallback. The try/catch is
 * kept anyway for a genuinely unexpected throw (e.g. attach itself failing).
 *
 * P11: the two renderers subscribe the session's awareness right after attach, so
 * remote cursors/selection boxes start drawing as soon as peers publish them.
 *
 * `tabIndex` defaults to the just-opened (last) tab, which is the open-scene caller's
 * case. The `sceneAccessGranted` handler passes an explicit index so an ALREADY-open
 * tab can be promoted to shared the moment it crosses the 2-user threshold, without a
 * window reload (the old client only ever evaluated this at open time). The early
 * `isShared` return makes that path idempotent if the tab is already collaborative.
