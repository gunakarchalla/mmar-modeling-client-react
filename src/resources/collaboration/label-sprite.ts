/**
 * Camera-facing text labels for collaborator presence: the name pill beside the point a
 * peer's ray lands on ({@link RemoteCursorRenderer}) and the name tag above a peer's
 * selection box ({@link RemoteSelectionRenderer}).
 *
 * Both are `THREE.Sprite`s carrying a canvas texture, rather than a mesh or the troika
 * `Text` the vizreps use, because they billboard for free: a label reads identically
 * from every collaborator's camera, whatever angle they are viewing the scene from.
 *
 * SIZING: labels hold a constant fraction of the viewport height rather than a fixed
 * world size — a named cursor that becomes unreadable when you zoom out has stopped
 * doing its job. `scaleLabel` is what maintains that, and callers must re-run it when
 * the local camera moves (both renderers do, from the animator's per-frame tick).
 *
 * DEPTH: the selection name tag is depth-tested like the rest of the presence helpers,
 * so it sits in the scene and geometry in front of it hides it. The cursor pill is not:
 * it tracks a moving pointer that is constantly passing behind things, and a name that
 * flickers as it grazes geometry is worse than one that stays legible.
 *
 * NO-CANVAS FALLBACK: the renderer suites run in vitest's node environment, where
 * `document` does not exist. Every canvas step is therefore optional — the sprite is
 * still built and positioned, just without a texture, so lifecycle and placement stay
 * testable without pulling in a DOM.
