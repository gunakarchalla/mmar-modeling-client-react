/**
 * Owns the lazy fetching of SceneInstances into `globalObject.sceneTree`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: SceneGroup's `initTree()` used to fetch every SceneInstance of
 * every SceneType at mount, and `GET /instances/sceneTypes/:uuid/sceneInstances`
 * returns *fully hydrated* scenes (the server's `getAllByParentUuid` calls
 * `getByUuid` per scene, which loads its ports, attributes, classes, roles and
 * relationclasses). So startup downloaded the complete contents of every scene the
 * user can read, and deep-cloned each one into a snapshot — a cost that scales with
 * the whole database rather than with the one scene the user actually opens.
 *
 * Now a SceneType's children are fetched the first time that type is expanded in the
 * tree. The consumer that genuinely needs *all* scenes (the cross-scene reference
 * attribute dialog) calls `loadAllSceneInstances` itself behind its own spinner, so the
 * total work is unchanged — it just moves off the startup path and only happens when
 * something really needs it. (The Copy/Delete/Share dialogs used to call it too, for
 * their scene pickers; those pickers are gone — the scene now arrives as the context
 * menu's payload.)
 *
 * The cache is module-level (not React state) because the tree it fills is the
 * engine-global `globalObject.sceneTree`, and non-component code (the dialogs, the
 * reference collectors) has to be able to ask "is this type loaded yet?" too.
 *
 * NOTE: this module deliberately does NOT take the per-SceneInstance snapshot that the
 * old eager `initTree()` took for every fetched scene. That baseline only matters for a
 * scene you actually open (it is what a rejected 403 edit reverts to), so SceneGroup
 * takes it in `openScene` instead. Keeping snapshot-service out of this module's import
 * graph also matters mechanically: it imports the engine's global-definition leaf, which
 * builds a real WebGLRenderer at module scope, and that would drag the whole engine into
 * every dialog test that merely lists scenes.

/**
 * Drop one SceneInstance from the tree after it has been deleted from the database.

 * merges by uuid and never removes (deliberately — see its note), and SceneGroup's
 * `updateTree` only adds. So the only way to make a row disappear used to be a full
 * `initTree()`, which the delete dialog reached for by publishing 'initSceneGroup'.
 * That rebuilt the entire tree from the database — refetching every metamodel file and
 * every SceneType — to remove one node whose uuid the caller already had in hand.
 * Deleting a SceneInstance cannot change the metamodel, so none of that work was
 * answering a question the delete had raised, and the rebuild took the tree's
 * local-only nodes down with it: an imported SceneType (ImportMetamodelDialog pushes
 * straight into `globalObject.sceneTypes`, which the rebuild overwrites), an imported
 * SceneInstance, and a scene created with autoSave off all disappear from the tree,
 * because the database's answer is the only one a rebuild keeps.
 *
 * Scans every type node instead of indexing by `uuid_scene_type`: this is a two-level
 * tree, so the scan is free, and a scene that somehow sits under two nodes should leave
 * both.
 *
 * The caller publishes 'updateSceneGroup' to re-render, and must close the scene's tab
 * BEFORE calling this — `updateTree` folds every open tab back into the tree.
