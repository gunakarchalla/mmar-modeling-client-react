/**
 * The reactive mirror of the current selection in the THREE scene.
 *
 * The engine is the source of truth (`globalObject.current_class_instance` /
 * `current_port_instance`) and writes here ONE WAY from the interaction handler; React
 * components read the identity of the selection from the store. The
 * `updateAttributeGui` / `removeAttributeGui` bus channels still exist alongside it as
 * the coarse "re-render everything" signal.
 *
 * `revision` covers the case the uuid cannot: gds objects are mutated IN PLACE, so an
 * attribute edit changes nothing React can observe. Bump it after such a mutation and
 * subscribers re-render.
