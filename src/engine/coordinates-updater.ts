/**
 * P4 port of the old `services/coordinates_updater.ts` (184 lines). Modeling-only
 * (the metamodeling twin has no equivalent). DI stripped per the established
 * recipe: InstanceUtility / MathUtility / Logger / GlobalDefinition injections
 * become module-singleton imports.
 *
 * Called from the animator's render loop whenever an object's position / rotation /
 * scale array stops matching the previous frame's: it writes the three.js transform
 * back onto the gds instance object graph (which auto-save then PATCHes).
 *
 * P10 filled in the three `sync*ToYDoc` privates (the plan §9 P4 says "the two
 * syncToYDoc privates" — there are actually THREE: coordinates, rotation, scale).
 * Each pushes the local delta into the tab's shared Y.Doc and marks the scene dirty
 * so AutoSave's shared branch PATCHes it.
 *
 * The `sharedDocService` import mirrors the old file's `SharedDocService` DI
 * injection — and is LOAD-BEARING beyond this file: constructing that singleton is
 * what sets `globalObject.sharedDocServiceRef`, the back-reference the other engine
 * handlers (interaction / deletion / transform-control-events / ray-helper) reach
 * collaboration through. This module is in engine/index.ts's graph, so the import
 * here guarantees the ref is wired at engine load. See state.json → P10 notes.
