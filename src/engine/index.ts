/**
 * engine/index.ts — COMPOSITION ROOT + mount facade (P2).
 *
 * Each engine module exports its own module singleton (the DI -> module-singleton
 * recipe that replaced Aurelia `@singleton()`). This file imports them in dependency
 * order — global-definition first, then the global-* state holders, then the leaf
 * helpers (ray-helper, mouse-object, resize), then the handlers/initiators — so the
 * import side effects (the `new ClassName()` at the bottom of each file) run in a
 * deterministic order. Cross-singleton wiring that would otherwise risk a circular
 * import is funnelled through this file (plan §3.1).
 *
 * P5 replaced the last P2 STUB: `interaction-handler` is now the full 5-mode state
 * machine, joined by `consistency-checker`, `instance-creation-handler` and
 * `deletion-handler` (imported below in dependency order — the handlers must
 * construct after graphic-context / the global-* holders they read at construction).
 * `transform-control-events` was replaced by P4. P11 un-stubbed the animator's
 * `remoteSelectionRenderer.refreshBoxes()` call — see its header.
 *
 * P4 added `graphic-context` (the vizRep `gc` API), `coordinates-updater` and
 * `vizrep-update-checker`. Importing `vizrep-update-checker` here is load-bearing,
 * not cosmetic: its constructor is what subscribes the `checkForVizRepUpdate*` bus
 * channels, so the module must be evaluated for vizrep refreshes to work at all.
 *
 * The `engine` facade exposes `mount(container)` / `unmount(token)` / `whenReady()`
 * for the React `ThreeCanvas`: it replaces the old `my-app.attached()` flow
 * (`initiator.init()` + `initiator.initEventListeners()`) and the old `#container`
 * DOM-polling — the container element is passed in directly. The mount-token +
 * memoized-init-promise pattern is copied from the metamodeling twin (see the long
 * comments below): it makes StrictMode's double-mount and per-tab remounts safe and
 * never recreates the single page-lifetime WebGLRenderer.
