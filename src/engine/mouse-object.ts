/**
 * Tracks the pointer in the 3D world: on every `pointermove` it raycasts against the
 * invisible modelling plane and parks `mousePointer3d` at the hit point. Relation
 * drawing uses that sphere as the line's floating end point.
 *
 * This is also the only pointer-motion path into `rayHelper.shootRay`, which is where
 * the collaboration cursor is broadcast — so a peer's cursor moves exactly as often as
 * this handler runs. `initiator.initEventListeners` registers it on the renderer's
 * canvas for that reason; see the comment there.
